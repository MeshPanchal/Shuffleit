# ShuffleIt 🎲📚

**ShuffleIt** is a productivity-focused web application built to help students revise more efficiently. It allows users to add their syllabus, organise subjects and topics, and then use a smart shuffle feature to randomly select 5 topics from any subject for quick revision.

---

## 🌟 Purpose

Studying the same topics in the same order can become monotonous and inefficient. ShuffleIt introduces a fun, randomised approach to revision, making it easier for students to stay engaged, reinforce knowledge, and cover a wide range of material without overthinking what to study next.
